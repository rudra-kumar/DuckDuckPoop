# Duck Duck Poop

This is a **networked multiplayer** game for iOS and Android developed at a gamejam within 48 hours, the game was developed in Unity3D and overrides their multiplayer network API.

This by no means represents good coding standards and is basically throwaway code, but good enough to give you an idea of overriding Unities API and instantiating multiple prefabs over the network. 

The reason why this was a challenge is because nowhere on the internet you can find a resource where you can instantiate two completely different characters over the network using Unities Networking API's and is very poorly documented.
